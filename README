I am a developer and a heavy user of terminal. I really wanted 
a consise list of all commands and tools i use in one convinient 
place so i can look up. I don't usually need an exhaustive list 
of options etc. I need the important switches i use often.

This project is a step towards making that list available. Its 
not exhaustive. But should be sufficient for intermediate level 
developers like me who use terminal a lot. 

I plan to add build systems and publish this list as iOS, 
Android and Web. For now, its just work in progress.
